# Tracker App

This App helps a student at Microvese track his progress as he moves forward in the course.  It requires a new user to create his own account before using it.  After the user signs up with his email and password, he would be presented with three forms to enter the hours and modules he covered and also to set his targets. There is 'TrackIt' page where he can view the data he entered in the past datewise and there is another screen 'Progress' which shows his progress with a progress bar.
